            <h1> About </h1>
            <p> My mathematical interests are mostly number theory and some algebraic geometry. 
                I like learning math, I am not good at research.
                 I haven't produced much original research lately unfortunately.<br> </p>

                 
            <p> I've been at  SUNY Old Westbury since 2011. 
                I received a B.S. in Math from MIT in 2003, and
                my Ph.D. in Math from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in 2008.
                My Ph.D. thesis advisor was Prof. Karen Smith.      
            
                After that I did a post-doc at University of Missouri-Columbia from 2008-2011, mentored by Prof. Dan Edidin.
